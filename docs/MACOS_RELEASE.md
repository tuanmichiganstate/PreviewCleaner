# macOS release procedure

The local build is for Apple Silicon on macOS 26 or later. Its app icon, Python,
Tcl/Tk, tkdnd, and PDF libraries are included. No Python installation is required
on the destination Mac. Developer ID signing and notarization are optional for
local development but required for the intended public distribution workflow.

## Build and local checks

Quit the running app, then run `bash scripts/build_macos.sh`. This runs the
regression suite, regenerates the icon, builds the app, verifies its signature,
and creates `dist/PreviewCleaner-macOS-arm64.zip`.

Without `MACOS_SIGN_IDENTITY`, PyInstaller applies an ad-hoc signature. That is
not a Developer ID signature or Apple notarization.

## Developer ID signing and notarization

1. On your Mac, install your **Developer ID Application** certificate with its
   private key into Keychain. Check it with `security find-identity -v -p codesigning`.
2. Create a notarytool Keychain profile locally using
   `xcrun notarytool store-credentials PreviewCleaner`. Follow its interactive
   prompts with your own Apple Developer credentials. Do not put credentials in
   this repository or chat.
3. Set the non-secret identity and profile names, then run:

   ```bash
   export MACOS_SIGN_IDENTITY='Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)'
   export NOTARY_PROFILE='PreviewCleaner'
   bash scripts/notarize_macos.sh
   ```

The script rebuilds with the identity, uploads the app archive to Apple's notary
service, requires an Accepted result, staples and validates the ticket, checks
Gatekeeper, and recreates the archive with the stapled app. Do not distribute an
archive if any command fails. Apple's [notarization workflow documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/customizing-the-notarization-workflow)
describes the service and credential setup.

## Acceptance on a separate clean Mac

This must be a separate machine or fresh VM with no project environment,
Homebrew, or Python dependencies. Testing another folder on the development
Mac is only a relocation check, not clean-Mac validation.

First run the built-in offline diagnostic (choose a new report filename):

```bash
/Applications/PreviewCleaner.app/Contents/MacOS/PreviewCleaner --self-test "$HOME/Desktop/PreviewCleaner-check.json"
```

The resulting JSON must contain `"passed": true`. This exercises native tkdnd
loading, a spawned worker, password handling, PDF rendering, always-on printing,
and cancellation, without using real documents. It does not substitute for the
Finder gesture and Gatekeeper checks below.

- Record macOS version, architecture, archive SHA-256, and app version.
- Transfer the final archive normally, extract it, copy the app to Applications,
  and open it through Finder with Gatekeeper protections intact.
- Drop `tests/fixtures/reportlab-supported.pdf` from Finder onto Original PDF.
  Analyze, navigate, and save a new PDF and report; reopen the exported PDF.
- Drop another PDF while one is loaded; test filenames with spaces and Unicode.
- Test a password-protected synthetic PDF: cancel the prompt, enter an incorrect
  password, then the correct password. Earlier open content must survive failures.
- Verify blocked-printing inputs show the security-removal notice and exported
  copies allow high-quality printing. Do not submit a physical print job unless wanted.
- Analyze a larger synthetic PDF, move the window during processing, cancel,
  restart, change options during processing, and close the app during a job.
- Reject folders and multi-file drops; refuse overwriting an existing output.
- Test unsupported, malformed, and signature-field fixtures without losing the original.
- Repeat offline after the notarization ticket is stapled.

Record actual results and failures in `docs/macos-build-validation.json`. Do not
mark Developer ID signing, notarization, or clean-Mac acceptance complete based
on the local ad-hoc build.
